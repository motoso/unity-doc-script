ムービーをフルスクリーンで再生する (Unity Pro のみ)
Note that player will stream movie directly
from the device storage, therefore you have to provide movie as a
separate files and not as a usual asset. You will have to create a
folder named @@StreamingAssets@@ inside your Unity project (inside your
Assets folder). Store your movies inside that folder.
Unity will automatically copy contents of that folder into the
application bundle.

Calling this function will pause Unity during movie playback. When
playback finishes Unity will resume.

The first parameter, @@path@@, can be a network-based URL. The function
will detect that by looking for a "://" substring that follows the
protocol name.

On iOS, @@Handheld.PlayFullScreenMovie@@ internally uses MPMoviePlayerController
object to play movies. Therefore, you should expect the same behavior
and the same supported formats. MPMoviePlayerController supports any
movie or audio files that already play correctly on an iPod or iPhone.

For movie files, this typically means files with the extensions .mov,
.mp4, .mpv, and .3gp and using one of the following compression
standards:

H.264 Baseline Profile Level 3.0 video, up to 640 x 480 at 30 fps.
Note that B frames are not supported in the Baseline profile.

MPEG-4 Part 2 video (Simple Profile).


Calling this function will initiate a transition that fades the screen
from your current content to the designated background color of the
player. When playback finishes, the player uses another fade effect to
transition back to your content.
