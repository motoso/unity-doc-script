CacheProceduralProperty(string,bool)
</signature>
指定した名前のプロパティをキャッシュするかを設定する
Specifies if a named ProceduralProperty should be cached for efficient runtime tweaking.
Set this to true for all properties that you expect to be tweaking.
It will take effect the next time the textures are rebuild, so call ::ref::RebuildTextures after setting up these flags in order to prepare the cache.
The fewer properties have caching enabled, the more efficient rebuilding the textures will be so consider carefully which properties are actually going to be changed.
While modified properties are automatically cached for the next rebuild, this cache flag is persistent.

SA: ::ref::IsProceduralPropertyCached, ::ref::ClearCache.
